# Personal Software Projects

These are just a plethora of personal, small, but interesting software projects that I've embarked on and completed- mostly in Python. 

They include anything from a small Python App, Full Stack with Django, Alarm Clocks, Web Scraping, Automation to update sheets, a full Youtube Clone Site, an Amazon price tracker, and more. 

Just a place to put my miscelleanous projects.
